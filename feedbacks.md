## Feedback - Labo 4 on Scripting

Grade : 5.7

### Task 2: Create thumbnails

Ex show_dimension :
- Perfect !

Ex rename_pictures :

- Your code will still add the dimensions if it's already in the name of the file that you copy.
- You create a folder even if there's no pictures renamed.

Ex make_thumbnails :

- If a file already has the word thumb in its name, your script still copies and creates a thumb from it. (no points lost because you had the same logic than the previous exercise)

- It was asked to use a template only for the beginning and end of the file. (here there's a middle part)
